# (Ford GoBike System Data)
## by (Bouchoucha Mohammed)


## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is "201902-fordgobike-tripdata". The dataset contains information on bike trips taken in February 2019 by customers and subscribers of the Ford GoBike bike-sharing program in the San Francisco Bay area.

Before starting the exploration, some data wrangling steps were performed on the dataset, which included:

Removing missing values
Dropping columns that are not necessary for the analysis
Converting data types of some columns
Removing outliers
The cleaned dataset was then used for the exploration and analysis.

## Summary of Findings

In this project, I explored the Ford GoBike trip data for February 2019.

First, I performed data cleaning and wrangling, which involved removing null values, dropping unwanted columns, converting data types, and extracting new features such as the duration of the trip.

In the univariate analysis, I examined the distributions of trip duration, start and end times, user types, and gender. I found that most trips were short, lasting less than 30 minutes, and that the majority of users were subscribers who used the bikes for commuting during rush hour on work days.

In the bivariate analysis, I investigated the relationship between trip duration and other variables such as user type, gender, and age. I found that customers tended to take longer trips than subscribers, and that female and other gender users also had longer trip durations than male users.

In the multivariate analysis, I explored the relationship between trip duration and multiple variables such as user type, gender, and day of the week. I found that the usage patterns of subscribers and customers differed significantly, with subscribers using the bikes primarily for commuting during work days and customers using them for leisure on weekends.

Overall, my analysis provided valuable insights into the usage patterns of the Ford GoBike system, and highlighted some interesting differences in usage between different user groups.

## Key Insights for Presentation

worker or student are the Subscriber and the tourist are the Customer that's why the suscbriber go on trip on working day from 7am to 9am and from 17pm to 19 pm
